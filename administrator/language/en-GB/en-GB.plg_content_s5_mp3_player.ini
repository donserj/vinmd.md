S5MP3="This plugin will show stream mp3 files in your Joomla content. There are many configuration options such as downloads and color options.<br /><br /><strong>USAGE: </strong><br />- Once installed, go to plugin manager and click on Shape 5 MP3 Player, publish the plugin and click save.<br />- To insert the audio player into your content simply type the following into your Joomla content:<br /><br /><strong>Manual start:</strong><br />{s5_mp3}http://www.yoursite.com/mp3s/your_file.mp3{/s5_mp3}<br /><strong>Auto start:</strong><br />{s5_mp3_auto}http://www.yoursite.com/mp3s/your_file.mp3{/s5_mp3_auto}<br /><br />Do not bold use bold on the mp3 strings. You can also set up a default path, see below for instructions.<br /><br /><strong>DEFAULT PATH:</strong><br />Rather than using a static string to call mp3s you can choose to pull your mp3s from a default path directory that contains all of your mp3 files, starting from the base directory of your Joomla installation. Leave blank if you are not using this feature. <br />- Simply create a folder in the root of your Joomla installation and enter the name of the folder below with no / just the name. When you create your mp3 plugin link it will now look like:<br /><br />{s5_mp3}song.mp3{/s5_mp3}<br /><br />As long as there is a file called song.mp3 in the folder name you specify the mp3 will play.<br /><br /><strong>TITLE AND AUTHOR: </strong><br />The text shown in the streaming bar is a combination of the mp3s author and title which is embedded into the mp3 file itself. If your bar is not showing the text then this information was either never saved to the mp3 or the mp3 resides on another server. Most servers block this type of data transfer from one server to another, for this reason you must have the mp3s on the same server as the plugin for the title and author to appear, you can still play and stream the file but no title will be shown. If your title is not embedded into the mp3 file itself there are several free mp3 tag editors which will allow you to change or add titles and authors to your files. A good and free program to do this can be found at <a href="http://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html" target="blank">http://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html</a>. You may need to clear your browsers cache to see the update.<br /><br /><strong>REPEAT COUNT: </strong><br />The repeat count is how many times you would like a file to repeat once it has completed. For no repeat simply enter 0.<br /><br /><strong>DOWNLOADS: </strong><br />Use the settings to the bottom right of this screen to setup downloads. Please note that downloads will only work when the mp3 is located on the same site as the S5 MP3 player plugin. The download bar is the bar is a a bar that will show below the player that shows the progress of the download.<br /><br /><strong>COLOR OPTIONS: </strong><br />Use the settings to the right to adjust the colors any portion of the player.<br /><br />Created by<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shape5.com">shape5.com</a> and modified from duvien.com."
